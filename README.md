# QueueR
QueueR (Coming Soon).

##RELEASE 0.0.1:
The barebones for Queue-R has been released! The goal of this release is to have a roadmap for the application. As of now, the user gets their "own" room where "other users" can submit song requests, but the rooms themselves are not dynamic and "live," so to speak. The host cannot send out that link to anyone and have them join to start requesting songs. This is the next step!
