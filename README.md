# QueueR
QueueR (Coming Soon).

#Phase 1:
The initial groundwork for this project will include a website where the user logs on to open up a queue for their preferred music application.
They will then be given a link to share to friends and other users who will use a search bar and a "current" queue view to
suggest songs to the host to add into their music application.
