# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is the goal?
QueueR is simply a tool to bring together music lovers from all platforms to request and share their favorite songs and music.

Eventually, the host will log into their spotify, generate a QR code, then share the code/link with their friends to have them join their unique room.

From there, users in the room can send specific song requests that will populate the host's queue inside their Spotify application, without the need for the host to lift a finger.

## Will I need Spotify Premium?
Eventually, yes the host will have to login with a premium account in order to use the tool, similar to Spotify's existing share-play capabilities.

## I have Apple Music, what about me?
No need to worry! All you need is a host's link to log on and make requests, right now you cannot be the host of your own room, but functionality for that is coming soon!
